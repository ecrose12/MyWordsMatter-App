// Each step names the page it belongs to (`path`) and a CSS selector
// (`element`) for the real DOM element to highlight. The tour engine
// walks these in order, automatically navigating to a new page whenever
// consecutive steps' paths differ. Steps flagged `menuAction: "about"`
// live inside the nav dropdown's About submenu — the tour engine opens
// that menu automatically right before showing them.
